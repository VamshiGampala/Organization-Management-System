Organization Management System
The Organization Management System (OMS) is a comprehensive software designed to streamline the management of resources, projects, clients, and vendors. It features functionalities for adding, updating, and viewing data for each entity through a user-friendly interface, promoting efficient operations. The workflow begins with creating a client entity, which serves as the foundation for project management. Projects are then created under their respective clients, facilitating task and milestone organization and tracking. Resources, including employees and contractors, are managed within the system, with the ability to assign them to specific projects. The system also supports adding vendors to streamline the procurement of external resources. Contract-based employees are associated with their respective vendors, ensuring smooth workforce procurement and allocation.

OMS is built using FastAPI for the backend, providing robust API endpoints for data manipulation, while Angular powers the frontend, offering a responsive and intuitive user experience. PostgreSQL is used as the database management system, ensuring reliable and scalable data storage and retrieval.

In essence, OMS optimizes organizational processes, enhances collaboration, and improves decision-making by centralizing the management of resources, projects, clients, and vendors.
